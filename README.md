Working on this project has been an eye-opening experience. I've encountered many challenged that I managed to overcome with the help of research (my supervisor).
It wasn't easy, making a webpage from scratch for the first time. But it is quite educational.
I've learnt many new things, dealt with problems I didn't think I'd encounter.
The final result might not be perfect, or pretty, but I find it satisfactory. I've come a long way and I'm still learning and finding my footing.
Projects like these mark an important milestone in learning, one fit for acknowledgment and celebration.
